hello hello =cmd|'/C start iexplore http://google.com'!A0 payload shows command injection vulnerability. When user input goes directly into os.popen() without validation, attackers can execute any system command. This payload opens Internet Explorer to Google but could be modified to delete files, steal data, or install malware. Always validate input and use subprocess.run() with argument lists instead of os.popen() with raw strings.
